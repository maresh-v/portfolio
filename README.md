Vít Mareš porfolio 2022/23

My modest portfolio, in which I summarize my study and work experience to date, and in which I also present a few examples of my work. These are small projects that I created in my spare time.

I am the author of the design and I implemented the website myself without any instructions, with the possible exception of minor partial problems.
